# Portfolio

# Description.

This is my homepage created using React and React-Boostrap. This
shows that I am able to use current technologies to create
a single page application. Though this does not have a backend, using
a single page application can be very useful because it will create less strain on a server. This also shows that I can make a respsonsive user interface.
